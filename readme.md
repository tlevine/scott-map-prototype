Map prototype for Scott
====
[Scott](http://scott.thomaslevine.com) is collecting data on applications to
dredge or fill Louisiana wetlands, and we want to display the overall data.

In particular, Scott thinks a choropleth map showing the impacts by watershed
would be informative. Here we prototype such a concept.
